 * Patch resources are used to modify existing Kubernetes resources by using
 * Server-Side Apply updates. The name of the resource must be specified, but all other properties are optional. More than
 * one patch may be applied to the same resource, and a random FieldManager name will be used for each Patch resource.
 * Conflicts will result in an error by default, but can be forced using the "pulumi.com/patchForce" annotation. See the
 * [Server-Side Apply Docs](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/kubernetes/how-to-guides/managing-resources-with-server-side-apply/) for
 * additional information about using Server-Side Apply to manage Kubernetes resources with Pulumi.
 * MutatingAdmissionPolicyBinding binds the MutatingAdmissionPolicy with parametrized resources. MutatingAdmissionPolicyBinding and the optional parameter resource together define how cluster administrators configure policies for clusters.
 *
 * For a given admission request, each binding will cause its policy to be evaluated N times, where N is 1 for policies/bindings that don't use params, otherwise N is the number of parameters selected by the binding. Each evaluation is constrained by a [runtime cost budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/#runtime-cost-budget).
 *
 * Adding/removing policies, bindings, or params can not affect whether a given (policy, binding, param) combination is within its own CEL budget.
