# K8spocalypse DR Readiness Summary

## ✅ Components Ready

### **1. Infrastructure**
- ✅ **EKS Clusters**: Both Milan (eu-south-1) and Dublin (eu-west-1) running EKS 1.33
- ✅ **VPC Peering**: Active between regions (10.0.0.0/16 ↔ 10.1.0.0/16)
- ✅ **ALB Ingress**: Working in both regions
  - Milan: `k8s-dev-dadjokes-123b200111-1633868653.eu-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
  - Dublin: `k8s-dev-dadjokes-d90c1c0b3d-1384696274.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- ✅ **Global Accelerator**: Deployed with traffic distribution (Milan 100%, Dublin 0%)

### **2. Applications**
- ✅ **All Pods Running**: 9 pods in each region (joke-server, joke-worker, MongoDB, Redis, NATS, operators)
- ✅ **NATS Timeout Protection**: Enhanced joke-worker with attempt limiting and fallback
- ✅ **Region Configuration**: Properly displays "milan" and "dublin" in responses
- ✅ **Service Discovery**: Fixed selector issues, services finding pods correctly

### **3. Backup & DR**
- ✅ **Velero Backups**: Running on 6-hour schedule (4 backups present)
- ✅ **EBS Snapshots**: DLM policies configured for hourly snapshots
- ⚠️ **MongoDB Replication**: Single-region instances (not cross-region replicated)

### **4. Durable Solutions Implemented**
- ✅ **Service Selector Fix**: Permanent in manifests + safety patch in dr-deploy
- ✅ **Region Variable**: Sed replacement with REGION_PLACEHOLDER
- ✅ **Deployment Scripts**: Updated dr-deploy function and deploy-with-region.fish
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete deployment guide with troubleshooting

## 🔧 DevSpace REGION Variable

**YES**, `REGION=milan devspace deploy -n dev` will work correctly:

```yaml
# devspace.yaml configured with:
vars:
  REGION:
    source: env
    default: "milan"
```

The Helm chart deployment uses `${REGION}` which DevSpace will substitute. However, the kubectl manifests in `custom-resources/` use our sed replacement approach for durability.

## 📊 MongoDB Cross-Region Status

**Current State**: Independent MongoDB instances in each region
- Milan: Single-member replica set
- Dublin: Single-member replica set
- **No cross-region replication** (mongodb-multiregion.yaml.disabled)

This is acceptable for the DR scenarios as they focus on:
1. Backup/restore mechanisms (Velero, EBS snapshots)
2. DNS failover timing
3. Health check behavior

## 🧹 Database Clearing

Use the provided script:
```fish
cd applications/dadjokes/deploy/devspace
./clear-db-and-cache.fish
```

This will:
- Clear all jokes from MongoDB
- Flush Redis cache
- Force joke-worker into "slow path" (generating new jokes)

## 📋 Pre-Scenario Checklist

1. ✅ Both clusters accessible and healthy
2. ✅ Applications deployed in both regions
3. ✅ ALBs responding with correct region
4. ✅ Velero backups running
5. ✅ Global Accelerator configured
6. ✅ NATS timeout protection in place
7. ✅ Durable deployment solutions implemented

## 🚀 Ready for Scenarios

The system is ready for all three DR scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1 - Data Loss**: Will demonstrate RPO differences
2. **Scenario 2 - Failover**: Will test DNS failover timing
3. **Scenario 3 - Health Checks**: Will compare naive vs dependency-aware checks

### Test Commands

```fish
# Test deployment with region
REGION=milan devspace deploy -n dev

# Clear database for testing
./clear-db-and-cache.fish

# Run scenarios
cd scenarios/scenario-1-data-loss && ./inject.sh
```

## 📝 Notes

- MongoDB cross-region replication is not configured, but this doesn't impact the DR scenarios
- The system will use Velero and EBS snapshots for data recovery demonstrations
- All fixes are durable and will persist across redeployments
